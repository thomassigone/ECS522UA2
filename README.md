## Instructions on running the application

Extract the .zip file and from the root of the directory that the file was extracted to first run npm install 
which will install all dependencies from package.json such as **axios** and **react-router-dom**:

1. npm install
2. npm start


**PS**: If any errors occur with the npm installation, please run **npm install axios** and **npm install react-router-dom** separately to ensure that these packages are installed but running npm install from the project directory where the package.json is will suffice. 

Which installs the dependencies needed by the application and then starts the app on http://localhost:3000.
